# FormGenerator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.13.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Open `./src/app/shared/services/form-structure.service.ts`  to change source JSON data about form.

If you click the submit button when the form is invalid you can see required inputs. Every input can be required or not.
You can use description for put some tips in separate blocks.

- test-input has 2 view: single (one input) and double (multi input) and you can use a placeholder.
- test-number has the maximum value in description.
- test-select has 2 view: cut and highlight
- test-checkbox has choices. Some choices can be checked default.

If you click the submit button when the form is valid you can see results in the Console of the Browser.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
